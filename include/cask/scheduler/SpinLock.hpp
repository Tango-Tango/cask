/**
 * In some (very rare) cases we would prefer to use a spinlock instead of a mutex. This is
 * typically true deep in scheduler code where, for latency and timer accuracy reasons, we'd
 * prefer to spin on a lock rather than sleep.
 * 
 * You shouldn't use this lock unless you're sure you need it. It's not as fair as a mutex
 * and can cause a lot of contention if used inappropriately.
 * 
 * This lock implementation exposes no methods directly to manipulate it. Instead it's expected
 * that the SpinLockGuard is used to lock and unlock the lock in a way that ensures safety.
